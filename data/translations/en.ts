I am comfortable taking responsibility beyond my title, and I expect the same level of seriousness from my environment. I learned that winning markets is less about perfect products, and more about securing distribution, attention, and initiative early. I operate as a sovereign hacker: someone who understands systems end-to-end—from human behavior and organizational dynamics down to code, APIs, and packets—and translates that understanding into real execution, users, and revenue.",
